# D3 Heat Map

Created as part of [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/).

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/learnyounode-solutions).

## Functionality

This is the [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) workshop, where I finish the various exercises involved in learning Node.js.

## Thoughts

This involved mostly familiar Javascript, but applied to some new contexts, such as creating HTTP servers and processing requests and responses. It's new territory, but I was able to knock all of these out in a few hours, so it's not too bad.

God bless.
